Carlota Ciganda was the Solheim Cup's homeland hero.

Caroline Hedwall began this weekâ€™s Solheim Cup as a controversial captainâ€™s pick. Then she sat the first three sessions. She played some spirited golf in a Saturday fourball â€” but it was in a losing effort. When she arrived at the 13th tee 3 down on Sunday, it felt as though sheâ€™d leave the week with nothing to show for it.
But then Hedwall birdied the 13th. She birdied the 14th. She parred the 15th. And on the next two holes she buried two of the more spectacular match-play putts youâ€™ll ever see.

When two mighty lashes got her to the middle of the par-5 18th in two shots, it was all but over. Hedwall didnâ€™t even have to putt out. Sheâ€™d secured a point. And that point all but secured the Solheim Cup for Europe.
Play began at the Solheim Cup Sunday with the score tied at 8 a piece. It ended the day tied as well, which means Europe retains the Cup.

Europe retains Solheim Cup 14-14
Every golfer serves a slightly different role on these teams, so itâ€™s tough to pick just one. But this week it was pretty easy.
Team Europe leaned on its stars, Leona Maguire and Linn Grant, who each went 3-2-0 on the week. Emily Pedersen and Maja Stark earned 2.5 points each. And they got that starring performance from Hedwall.
But there was nobody equal to Carlota Ciganda, who wasnâ€™t just the heart and soul of the European team, but also playing on her home turf with this being the first Solheim Cup held in her native Spain.
Ciganda was a perfect 4-0-0 on the week, the only golfer on either side who finished with an unblemished mark.
It was fitting for Ciganda to clinch the winning point for Europe by defeating Nelly Korda, perhaps the best player on either side, 2 and 1 in singles. 
As Hedwall was making her move in her dramatic comeback from 3 down against Ally Ewing, Ciganda was making a move of her own. But it didnâ€™t start the way she wanted to.
Ciganda shanked a shot from the fairway on 15 and made six on the par-5, allowing Korda to tie the match for the first time since the opening hole.
She then responded by hitting both her approaches at 16 and 17 within five feet for birdies. Her approach on 16 settled inside Kordaâ€™s who had played before here and the American missed birdie effort to fall back to 1 down. 
Carlota Ciganda answers Nelly Korda's approach with an even closer shot to set up birdie and take a 1UP lead. ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ºðŸ“º: Golf Channel & @peacock | #SolheimCup2023 pic.twitter.com/Lz2sFh5hqB
Cigandaâ€™s putt to clinch the Cup for the Europeans was just three feet.
