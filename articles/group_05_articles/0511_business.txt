The S&P 500 climbed on Monday to kick off the final week in a September that has seen big losses so far.
The broader index rose 0.4% to 4,337.44. The Nasdaq Composite closed higher by 0.45% at 13,271.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 43.04 points, or 0.13%, to 34,006.88. All three major averages snapped four-day losing streaks.
The 10-year Treasury yield was last higher by 10 basis points at 4.542%, reaching its highest level since 2007 when it hit 4.57%.
Stocks broadly shrugged off moves in the bond market. Chemical giant Dow was the best-performing member of the 30-stock index, rising 1.7% after an upgrade from JPMorgan. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors were in positive territory, with energy leading the gains, up 1.3%.
Amazon shares climbed more than 1% after the online retail giant said Monday it will invest up to $4 billion in artificial intelligence firm Anthropic.
"This performance is surprisingly strong. And I think that it's really two reasons why the market isn't unhinging, one I think is technical, because [there is] a lot of support for the market at 4,300," said Jay Hatfield, chief executive officer at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. "It may not hold but there's support there."
"And then people are waiting for the right moment to get back on AI boom trade," he added.
Stocks have struggled this month as the Federal Reserve signaled higher interest rates for longer, sending bond yields higher. The market also contended with a rally in crude oil and a winning streak in the dollar during the seasonally weak trading month. Energy is the top-performing S&P 500 sector in September, up by more than 2%.
The S&P 500 has fallen nearly 4% in September, on pace for its second straight losing month and its worst month since December. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down 5.4% in September as growth stocks bore the brunt of the sell-off, also headed for its biggest monthly loss since December. The blue-chip Dow is off by a more modest 2% this month.
Investors are also closely monitoring progress on a budget resolution in Washington. Lawmakers over the weekend expressed few signs of movement on a deal that would keep the U.S. government funded for the remainder of the fiscal year. On Monday, Moody's Investors Service warned a shutdown would be a "credit negative" event for the U.S.
