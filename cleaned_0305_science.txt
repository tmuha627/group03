: istock , lightfieldstudios globally , estimate 55 million people suffer alzheimer disease form 
dementia , number expect rise steeply come years.1 decade , scientist study genetic contribution risk 
resilience context disease , hop shed light disease process identify new molecular targets.in 2019 , 
researcher discover genetic quirk know apoe3 christchurch mutation seem protect autosomal dominant alzheimer disease adad 
, early-onset , genetically determine form disease.2 , researcher identify second protective mutation : gain-of-function 
mutation reln , gene encode protein reelin.3 reelin play many important role brain structure function 
, include process like neuronal migration synaptic plasticity . newly discover reln gene variant , 
researcher name reln-colbos , provide new insight signal pathway may protect patient devastate disease.this discovery 
would not_ happen without generosity patient-joseph arboleda-velasquez , harvard medical schoolthis discovery would not_ happen 
without generosity patient , say coauthor joseph arboleda-velasquez , study neurodegenerative disease brain retina harvard 
medical school . amazing see one person commit research make huge difference.for many year , 
arboleda-velasquez international team scientist study large cohort related individual colombia adad cause mutation call psen1-e280a 
. carrier mutation develop mild cognitive impairment average age 44 year age . , researcher 
learn man carry mutation remain cognitively healthy late 60 , decide investigate further.neuroimaging study perform 
man 73 year old reveal elevate level amyloid beta plaque cortex compare individual psen1-e280a mutation 
. however , others cohort generally young , simply average age death 59 years.4 additionally 
, area man brain tau tanglesaggregations hyperphosphorylated tau proteinsthat similar individual cohort . however , 
entorhinal cortexa brain region important memory formation retrievalwas relatively spar , may account persistence cognitive 
abilities.the researcher wonder might explain lack tau pathology certain brain region . genetic analysis show 
unlike first patient , man wasnt protect apoe3 christchurch mutation . undeterred , researcher keep 
explore eventually discover unusual reln variant man genome . quite interesting , say arboleda-velasquez . 
although different gene , reln apoe common function . gene product play role regulate phosphorylation 
tau.5to explore mechanism variant could provide protection alzheimers disease , researcher study effect reln-colbos mouse 
. discover male mouse mutation great phosphorylation dab1 , protein involve prevent tau hyperphosphorylation.6 interestingly 
, effect not_ observe female mouse . keep sex-specific effect , original patient sister carry 
psen1-e280a reln-colbos mutation partially protect adad : develop mild cognitive impairment age 58.next , researcher 
examine effect mutation mouse model tauopathy . experiment , , suggest protective effect . mouse 
display reduce tau phosphorylation hippocampi.arboleda-velasquez think theres probably story tau phosphorylation , however ; several 
potential protective mechanism could still await discovery . brain , say , reelin heavyweight . 
reelin play important role development adulthood , scientist implicate aberrant reelin signal myriad neurological psychiatric 
disorders.7ultimately , however , arboleda-velasquez say , mechanism not_ important discovery come people . come 
people , know two thing . one work . two : safe . arboleda-velasquez personally 
enjoy investigate fundamental biological mechanism plan study various way reln variant provide protection . however 
, say , not_ early begin explore treatment base genetic finding . patient tell us 
exactly , said.steven estus , molecular geneticist university kentucky college medicine not_ involve study , 
say base finding , reelin absolutely worth pursue . however , reelin play important role 
brain development , important determine whether protection provide mutation developmental effect late-stage effect . would 
tell really something potential treatment , say . work need determine whether target pathway effective 
, highlight promising new research avenue disease desperately need treatment option . referencesadi - dementia
