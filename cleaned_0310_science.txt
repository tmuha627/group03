2023 , 6:26 pm utc body : nasa complete first-ever sample return mission asteroid today 
, science capsule contain material asteroid landing travel 1.2 billion-mile journey asteroid bennu . capsule 
release osiris-rex spacecraft pass earth morning , enter atmosphere around 27,000 mph . osiris-rex mission 
, launch 2016 , collect much several hundred gram asteroid material , could help scientist 
understand early stage solar system . nasa invests small body mission like osiris-rex investigate rich 
population asteroid solar system give us clue solar system form evolve , say melissa morris 
, osiris-rex program executive , mission overview briefing . origin story . capsule release osiris-rex 
spacecraft pass earth morning science capsule slow parachute land department defense utah test training range 
10:52 et , landing area choose large restricted airspace united state use previous nasa sample 
return mission like genesis stardust . landing area 36 mile 8.5 mile , entire mission 
require high level precision particularly spacecraft rendezvous asteroid collect sample 2020. really precise navigation require 
orbit bennu touch collect sample , meter away target , sandra freund , osiris-rex program 
manager , say pre-landing briefing . illustrate kind navigation precision weve throughout mission . recovery 
teams collect sample utah desert , helicopter carry sample take 12:15 pm et . capsule 
take temporary clean room first disassembly , remove large part backshell . undergo process call 
nitrogen purge nitrogen pump canister protect sample . prevent earth atmosphere enter ship johnson space 
center houston , texas , canister open first time sample analyze . photo george frey/afp 
via getty image need asteroid sample ? really interested trace organic molecular chemistry , dante 
lauretta , osiris-rex principal investigator , tell verge . really want understand thing use biology 
today , like amino acid make protein nucleic acid make gene form ancient asteroid body 
deliver earth space ? youre not_ familiar model formation solar system , idea might sound 
outlandish , border fantastical . actually fairly well-supported widely accept theory key element life come 
earth . important clear theory not_ life arise elsewhere deliver earth , rather basic building 
block life often refer organic compound could arrive billion year ago carry asteroid . thats 
theory decade ; test , scientist need access asteroidal material . go visit asteroid use 
instrument spacecraft study good start , kind detailed analysis scientist want require much big laboratory 
, equip instrument like mile-wide type particle accelerator call synchrotron would impossible fit onto spacecraft 
. form ancient asteroid body deliver earth space ? anot_her option study meteorite , piece 
matter include asteroid come space fall earth surface . thats research perform historically , use 
tiny fragment sample . two problem approach . firstly , meteorite fall , doesnt context 
solar system come . researcher cant know origin , see body close , give important 
clue interpretation data . secondly , time meteorite pass earth atmosphere land , may pick 
matter along way contaminate local environment . scientist look trace organic compound , need know 
anything find come space wasnt pick earth . , need asteroid sample pristine possible . 
thats osiris-rex come . worldwide effort osiris-rex mission first time nasa bring back sample asteroid 
, follow footstep japanese space agency jaxa , collect two asteroid sample historic hayabusa hayabusa 
2 mission . though first hayabusa mission gather tiny amount material , second mission manage 
return around five gram material asteroid ryugu 2020. osiris-rex return much material asteroid bennu , 
around 250 gram , mean science particularly look small amount trace material . researcher see 
two mission complementary , rather competitive . not_ asteroid , say lauretta , also member 
hayabusa 2 team . ryugu bennu similar spinning-top-like shape , look different . ryugu large 
red color , bennu small blue . scientist still arent sure difference color mean , 
able analyze compare sample earth help understand asteroid similar differ . look not_ two sample 
analysis program , one big sample analysis program , lauretta say , worldwide effort . 
window early solar system scientist want understand earth form , need look beyond planet solar 
system . star system form enormous cloud gas collapse star center , spin disk material 
around . thats clear look star system , also evidence solar system : planet revolve 
around sun direction single plane , support idea form single disk material.some material coalesce planet 
, sweep early asteroid , number still exist today . scientist want understand earth form 
, need look beyond planet solar system fact , estimate age solar system come date 
grain within meteorite fall earth . thats earth factor like erosion plate tectonics recycle rock 
wipe away early history planet , mean old rock ever find around 4 billion year 
old . material asteroid , however , even old . asteroid date 500 million year 
earlier time old rock earth . geologist , want go back way beginning , lauretta 
say . fun thing , youre look asteroid go literally beginning solar system . bennu 
, asteroid osiris-rex collect sample , think make material around 4.5 billion year old , 
make potential time capsule early stage solar system . researcher cant know age sure detailed 
analysis perform . image : nasa new asteroid target osiris-rex spacecraft drop capsule contain sample 
, initial job . spacecraft still space , even though cant collect anot_her sample still 
power propulsion system , science instrument still operate . rather waste craft , become osiris-apex 
go study new target , asteroid apophis . fortunate chance orbital dynamic , able rendezvous 
asteroid one famous solar system , come close earth next year study . 2029 , 
april , apophis gon na fly within 30,000 kilometer surface earth , altitude weather satellite 
orbit , lauretta say . big , close flyby asteroid thousand year , may even 
visible naked eye location earth . osiris-apex able follow asteroid path around earth meet , 
perform science observation . sample asteroid bennu , take special facility nasas johnson space center 
houston , work begin understand chemistry precious commodity . get sample back earth beginning science 
research , team anxiously await culmination effort . get one first people earth see capsule 
, position desert . go quite emotional moment , lauretta say . weve build test 
design thing 12 year . end , long journey , beginning next chapter .
