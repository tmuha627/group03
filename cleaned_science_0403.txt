successfully deliver nasa first asteroid sample collect space , osiris-rex mission , rename osiris-apex 
, embark new journey time study asteroid closely approach earth years.apophis , space rock roughly 
1,200 foot 366 meter across , come within 20,000 mile 32,187 kilometer earth 5 year 
, close satellite orbit planet 10 time near moon . asteroid name egyptian god chaos 
darkness believe shape like peanut.one hour apophis make close approach earth april 13 , 2029 
, osiris-apex short origin , spectral interpretation , resource identification security-apophis explorer use earths gravity 
enter orbit around asteroid closely study 18 months.its extensive new chapter spacecraft already quite journey 
. osiris-rex , spend seven year round trip near-earth asteroid bennu , include time spend 
surveying , touch collect sample space rock.now , sample new home nasas johnson space center 
houston , analysis rock soil collect near-earth asteroid bennu could reveal insight origin solar system 
composition asteroid could collide earth future.the spacecraft wont able collect sample apophis , sample collection 
head include capsule bennu sample deliver earth . osiris-apex use gas thruster attempt kick dust 
small rock apophis surface study 15 month orbit asteroid.apophis interest s-type , stony , asteroid 
, contrast bennu , c-type , carbonaceous , asteroid.c-type asteroid make clay silicate rock , 
s-types comprise silicate material nickel-iron.the spacecraft ability closely orbit asteroid reveal surface strength stony asteroid 
much weather asteroid endures space environment.but planning defend earth anot_her key motivation extended mission . 
stony asteroid part common class potentially hazardous asteroid pose threat planet . understand composition detail 
obtain close orbit could help agency nasa partner determine best deflect asteroid predict collision course 
earth.apophis one infamous asteroid , say dani dellagiustina , principal investigator osiris-apex . first discover 
2004 , concern would impact earth 2029 close approach . risk dismiss subsequent observation , 
close asteroid size get 50 year asteroid closely tracked , next 100 year asteroid discover 
far.it get within one-tenth distance earth moon 2029 encounter , add dellagiustina , assistant professor 
planetary science university arizona . people europe africa able see naked eye , thats close 
get . stoke find mission extended.observations apophis orbit around sun 2021 rule risk space rock 
impact earth 2068 , accord nasa center near-earth object studies.the center maintain risk list , 
track asteroid orbit bring close earth close enough cause concern potential impact . scientist center 
use radar telescope study near-earth object understand danger may pose planet.keeping eye apophis close approach 
earth enable scientist see whether shift orbit could affect likelihood hit earth future , well 
change asteroid surface rotation rate.dellagiustina long history spacecraft also currently work deputy principal investigator analysis 
bennu sample . freshman university arizona 2004 , take asteroids seminar taught dante lauretta , 
regents professor planetary science principal investigator osiris-rex mission . dellagiustina lead student experiment design discovery 
version call osiris back , lauretta recall . , take spacecraft next adventure .
