7 long-awaited asteroid sample land us ashley strickland , cnn atlanta , georgia update 
12:14 edt , mon september 25 , 2023 asteroid sample collect nasa touch earth , 
give scientist opportunity learn origin solar system capture piece massive space rock chance collide planet 
future . first time agency accomplish feat.seven year launch space , osiris-rex spacecraft flew earth 
sunday deliver pristine sample near-earth asteroid bennu.osiris-rex , stand origin , spectral interpretation , resource 
identification , security , regolith explorer , lift 2016 begin orbit bennu 2018. spacecraft collect 
sample 2020 set lengthy return trip earth may 2021. mission travel 3.86 billion mile total 
bennu back.the spacecraft drop sample capsule contain estimate 8.8 ounce asteroid rock soil distance 63,000 
mile 102,000 kilometer earth surface early sunday , enter planet atmosphere 10:42 a.m. et travel 
speed 27,650 mile per hour 44,498 kilometer per hour .parachutes deploy slow capsule gentle touchdown 
11 mile per hour 17.7 kilometer per hour . sample land defense department utah test 
training range 10 minute enter atmosphere , minute ahead schedule.congratulations osiris-rex team . , say 
nasa administrator bill nelson . bring something extraordinary , large asteroid sample ever receive earth 
. mission prove nasa big thing , thing inspire us , thing unite us . 
wasnt mission impossible . impossible become possible.osiris-rex continue tour solar system spacecraft already set capture 
detailed look different asteroid name apophis.the mission new name : osiris-apex , origin , spectral 
interpretation , resource identification , security-apophis explorer.four helicopter transport recovery research team landing site conducted 
assessment make sure capsule wasnt damage way , say rich burn , osiris-rex project manager 
nasas goddard space flight center greenbelt , maryland . team confirm capsule not_ breach landing.recovery 
team , train event month , retrieve capsule safe , say sandra freund , osiris-rex 
program manager lockheed martin space , partner nasa build spacecraft , provide flight operation help 
recover 100-pound capsule.the initial recovery team , outfit protective glove mask , ensure capsule cool 
enough touch , give reach temperatures 5,000 degree fahrenheit 2,760 degree celsius reentry , burn 
say . team also ensure capsule battery didnt rupture leak toxic fumes.a science team collect 
sample landing site , include air , dust dirt particles.one key scientific objective osiris-rex return 
pristine sample pristine mean foreign material hamper investigation sample analysis , say dante lauretta , 
osiris-rex principal investigator university arizona tucson . unlikely , want make sure material utah range 
may interact sample well documented.lauretta work mission nearly twenty year remembers part idea present nasa 
. lauretta present step way , include capsule assemble instal spacecraft launch . sunday , 
one first people approach capsule land welcome home.it like see old friend hadnt see long 
time , say . want give hug . one key moment see . know , 
pull . incredible seem year ago , come be.a helicopter carry sample cargo net deliver 
temporary clean room near landing site . within space , curation team conduct nitrogen flow 
, call purge , prevent earth atmosphere enter sample canister contaminate . large piece capsule 
strip away , say nicole lunning , osiris-rex curation lead nasas johnson space center houston.a 
team prepare sample canister transport c-17 aircraft nasas johnson space center houston monday . scientist 
expect remove lid see sample first time tuesday.the recovery team also assess footage capture descent 
determine drogue parachute , use initially stabilize capsule , deploy time . time expect release 
, team unable see visual evidence . main parachute , responsible slow capsule safe landing 
speed , also deploy early.but end day , main chute deployed , basically correct sin 
may happen ahead , say tim priser , chief engineer deep space exploration lockheed martin 
. touch like feather.details sample reveal nasa broadcast johnson space center october 11. science team 
not_ time fully assess sample , researcher plan collect fine-grained material top canister tuesday quick 
analysis share october , lauretta say . initial analysis look presence mineral chemical element , 
said.scientists analyze rock soil next two year dedicated clean room inside johnson space center . 
sample also divide send laboratory around globe , include osiris-rex mission partner canadian space agency 
japanese aerospace exploration agency . 70 % sample remain pristine storage future generation good technology 
learn even whats possible.if government shutdown occur , not_ endanger curation safe handling asteroid sample 
, say lori glaze , director nasas planetary science division.certain step lead highly anticipate analysis 
possibly delay , sample remain protected safe despite disruption schedule , say news conference friday 
. sample wait 4 billion year human study take us little long , think well 
ok.along previously return sample asteroid ryugu japan hayabusa2 mission , rock soil could reveal key 
information beginning solar system . scientist believe carbonaceous asteroid bennu crash earth early planet formation 
, deliver element like water.scientists believe asteroid bennu representative solar system old material forge large 
die star supernova explosion , glaze say . reason , nasa invest mission devote small 
body increase understanding solar system form evolved.but sample also provide insight bennu , chance collide 
earth future.its crucial understand population near-earth asteroid may eventual collision course planet . good grasp 
composition orbit key predict asteroid may close approach earth essential develop method deflect asteroid base 
composition .
