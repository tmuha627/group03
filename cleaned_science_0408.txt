osiris-rex spacecraft swing earth sunday , expect deliver rare cosmic gift : pristine sample 
collect near-earth asteroid bennu.if go accord plan , spacecraft release capsule contain estimate 8.8 ounce 
asteroid rock soil space toward land zone utah desert.nasa provide live stream sample delivery beginning 
10 a.m. et sunday . capsule expect enter earth atmosphere 10:42 a.m. et , travel 
27,650 mile per hour 44,498 kilometer per hour . land utah 13 minute later.after release 
capsule , osiris-rex continue tour solar system capture detailed look different asteroid name apophis.studying sample 
help scientist understand key detail origin solar system asteroid leftover early day 4.5 billion year 
ago . sample also provide insight bennu , chance collide earth future.returning nasa first asteroid 
sample collect space earth year making . heres look mission milestone far lie ahead.osiris-rex , 
stand origin , spectral interpretation , resource identification , security-regolith explorer , quite journey past 
seven year . launch cape canaveral 2016 , nasa spacecraft arrive orbit around bennu december 
2018.the first us mission send near-earth asteroid , osiris-rex make history several time . perform 
close orbit planetary body spacecraft . bennu become small object ever orbit spacecraft.osiris-rex survey asteroid 
entirety determine best location collect sample . bennu , rubble-pile asteroid shape like spin top 
, one-third mile 500 meter wide compose rock bound together gravity.the view bennu provide spacecraft 
afford mission team unprecedented insight asteroid , include discovery water ice lock within bennus rock 
carbon form largely associate biology . team also witness particle asteroid release space.the spacecraft spiral 
close closer asteroid go historic tag , touch-and-go sample collection event , october 20 , 
2020.along way , challenge threaten success mission , include sample collection head spacecraft collect much 
material container couldnt seal properly , leak precious asteroid material space.during historic collection event , 
sample head osiris-rex spacecraft sink 1.6 foot 0.5 meter surface asteroid . apparently , bennus 
exterior make loosely packed particle arent bound together securely , base happen spacecraft collect sample 
. spacecraft hadnt fire thruster back away quick collection dust rock , might sink right 
asteroid.thats mission team learn asteroid surface similar pit plastic balls.the osiris-rex team able meet overcome 
challenge , spacecraft slat return large sample collect nasa mission since apollo astronaut bring back 
lunar rock decades ago.the team also able organize final flyby bennu spacecraft april 2021 , 
allow chance see osiris-rex disturbed alter surface asteroid collection event . photo show intriguing difference 
create sample collection firing spacecraft thruster push away asteroid , include move rearrange large boulder 
asteroid surface.since bidding bennu farewell may 2021 , osiris-rex return trip earth , circle sun 
twice fly planet right time drop asteroid sample.nasa lockheed martin space spend much year rehearse 
every step sample retrieval process.if spacecrafts trajectory track , sample capsule expect release osiris-rex 63,000 
mile 102,000 kilometer earth early sunday . since depart bennu , spacecraft make numerous maneuver 
fire thrustersso fly earth right time release capsule . capsule landwithin area 36 mile 8.5 
mile 58 kilometer 14 kilometer defense department utah test training range.parachutes deploy slow capsule gentle 
touchdown 11 mile per hour 17.7 kilometer per hour , recovery team stand retrieve capsule 
safe , say sandra freund , osiris-rex program manager lockheed martin space , partner nasa 
build spacecraft , provide flight operation help recover capsule.a helicopter carry sample cargo net deliver 
temporary clean room establish range june . , team prepare sample container transport c-17 aircraft 
nasas johnson space center houston monday . detail sample reveal nasa broadcast johnson october 11.scientists 
analyze rock soil next two year dedicated clean room inside johnson space center.its crucial understand 
population near-earth asteroid bennu may eventual collision course planet . good grasp composition orbit key 
predict asteroid may close approach earth , well develop method deflect asteroids.the sample divide send 
laboratory around globe , include osiris-rex mission partner canadian space agency japanese aerospace exploration agency 
. 70 % sample remain pristine storage future generation good technology learn even whats possible.the 
sample reveal information formation history solar system well role asteroid help develop habitable planet earth 
. scientist believe carbonaceous asteroid bennu crash earth early formation , deliver element like water.were 
look clue earth habitable world rare jewel space ocean protective atmosphere , say dante lauretta 
, osiris-rex principal investigator university arizona tucson.we think material bring carbon-rich asteroid early planetary system 
formation . believe bring back kind material , literally maybe representative seed life asteroid deliver 
beginning planet lead amazing biosphere , biological evolution us today .
