( human term : transistor really really really freakin small . ) panther lake well underway keep picture phone something keep track . gelsinger confirm cpu generation call panther lake set announce 2025 company begin work . ( name leak earlier year intel engineer accidentally put linkedin . ) know almost not_hing panther lake right intel say slat enter production fabs soon q1 2024. keep track ( let honest know ) mean progression likely go : meteor ( 2023 ) arrow ( 2024 ) lunar ( 2024 probably ) panther ( 2025 ) . modular chiplets work pat gelsinger reveals pike creek . gelsinger show pike creek world first work ucie-enabled chiplet-based processor . ucie stand universal chiplet interconnect express essentially plug-and-play standard allow different silicon module work together one chiplet package . one chipmaker could grab anot_her companys chiplet snap design . theory would allow chipmakers good specialize certain type chiplets bring product market quickly . intel use ucie interface post-arrow lake first company show functional silicon . ( intel donate first version ucie spec standard body thats develop . ) resin glass glaaaaasss . intel currently use organic resin foundation chip . company announce begin transition new technology let chip sit bed glass . give intel room pack additional transistor well ( intel expect ) good data transfer less warping less mechanical breakage heat . get excited : isnt come second half decade first appear like giant data center stuff . couple reporter get see production process inside intels factory . cnet cool photo . xeon thing happen whole lot core . gelsinger announce upcoming sierra forest xeon processor 288 e-cores . know case find however many core right insufficient backyard data center . intel also confirm 5th-gen emerald rapid xeon line launch december 14th year . pat gelsinger swiftie relate . - pat gelsinger probably . actually say colleague craig suggest might case gelsinger kind nod sheepish way proof need . think favorite album ? get reputation vibe . see eras tour pat !
