5 ) surprising jellyfish finding challenge whats know learning memory jenna schnuer cnn atlanta georgia update 11:38 edt mon september 25 2023 sign cnns wonder theory science newsletter.explore universe news fascinate discovery scientific advancement more.caribbean box jellyfish animal may appear float life aimlessly central brain still ability learn rapidly retain information new research found.this find upend long-held idea organisms cant engage associative learning without central nervous system accord study publish friday journal current biology.the study lead anders garm associate professor marine biology university copenhagen denmark part ongoing research jellyfish behavior institute physiology kiel university germany.weve look visual behavior kind experiment learning natural progression say first author jan bielecki postdoctoral fellow visual neuroethology kiel.after year work caribbean box jellyfish team shock find animal could learn surprise fast learn bielecki said.caribbean box jellyfish also know scientific name tripedalia cystophora 24 eye six four visual sensory center call rhopalia . gelatinous body jellyfish know bell shape easily bruise potential disadvantage creature move among mangrove root caribbean . swim root could cause damage lead bacterial infection eventual death bielecki said.so absolutely certain animal able learn ( avoid mangrove root ) critical learning process want survive said.to test animal ability learn researcher line inside round tank gray white stripe . gray stripe would appear jellyfish 24 eye dark faraway mangrove root natural habitat . period 7.5 minute researcher observe jellyfish see whether animal bump stripe learn keep distance.in first several minute jellyfish swam fairly close bump wall . within five minute thing changed.the jellyfish receive combination visual stimulation stripe mechanical stimulation bump obstacles.they learn get stimulus concurrently ( ) avoid obstacle bielecki say . increase performance parameter measure obstacle avoidance.the researcher replace stripe solid gray field . jellyfish bump again.there visual cue didnt learn anything bielecki say . keep bump stuff responding.finally researcher run neurophysiological experiment build around rhopalia give electric signal drive pulsing motion swim contraction jellyfish make propel water . speed pulsing increase dramatically move avoid obstacle.the scientist isolate rhopalia sever bell . mangrove root stand-in move around . jellyfish sight mechanism still line move . could visual system learn avoid gray line ? scientist connect system could send weak electric signal visual sensory center . rhopalia didnt naturally activate signal would stimulate swim contraction scientist . soon rhopalia start send signal without prompting even light gray bar provide far less contrast rest environment.bielecki say achieve finding experiment behavior relevant jellyfish . researcher put animalsin situation similar something would experience wild.so visual stimulation mechanical stimulation something ( occurs ) natural habitat say . know exactly this.the study strong say dr. michael abrams researcher department molecular cell biology university california berkeley extensive work jellyfish sleep . abrams involve new research.the scientist devise convincing experimental paradigm quantify associative learning box jellyfish . finding may also evidence amount short-term memory abrams say email . add study clearly demonstrate animal ability learn wonder long memory lasts.while get doctorate california institute technology abrams work 2017 study upside-down jellyfish ( cassiopea ) sleep-like state also consider behavior exist animal central nervous system .
