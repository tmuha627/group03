12 ) ancient jawless fishs head fossilize 3d hint evolution vertebrate skull mindy weisberger cnn atlanta georgia publish 8:26 pm edt thu september 21 2023 hundred million year ago jawless fish swim earths sea brain protect outside armored skin inside plate make cartilage . scientist still piece together modern vertebrate skull evolve ancient fish ancestor first animal backbone . recent analysis spectacular fossil fill gaps.the specimen articulated cranium thats 455 million year old belongs jawless fish eriptychius americanus . discover harding sandstone formation colorado old 3d fossil evidence cranial anatomy early vertebrate accord study publish wednesday journalnature.modern vertebrate descendant jawless fish make two group : vertebrate jaw jawless hagfish lamprey . skull arrangement e. americanus unlike anything see living vertebrate fish extinct relative unfused cartilage section symmetrical front head surround mouth olfactory organ eyes.you get weird set unpaired paired cartilage anything else say lead study author dr. richard dearden postdoctoral research fellow naturalis biodiversity center leiden netherlands . quite exciting.the fossilize head cartilage excavate 1949 describe 1967 late paleontologist robert denison curator fossil fish chicagos field museum natural history . denison split rock hold fossil material two piece ; one dissolve rocky matrix acid suspend fossil epoxy dearden said.denisons analysis reveal uniquely shape armored scale structure resemble cartilage . time impossible look deep without cut fossil destroy dearden said.the detail extract surface fossil arent really sufficient able anything explain . specimen scientifically back-burnered decade see potentially interest basically unusable.by use ct scan dearden coauthor able identify visualize cartilage . team reconstruct digital model fishs cranium 3d dearden tell cnn . ( conduct research university birmingham united kingdom . ) suspect reason take long someone scan people actually work ordovician fish kind fossil really need specialist recognise potential say email.jawless fish theordovician period 488.3 million 443.7 million year ago call ostracoderm armored skin know fossil preserve external armor dearden said.everything know inside head basically work basis armor dearden explain . see eye hole outside armor assume thats eye skull . know anything actually whats inside there.the study author identify 10 cartilage skull piece specimen six epoxy four rocky matrix . scale wrap around canal may hold sensory vascular structure thread cartilage.questions skull evolution still remain purpose canal see fossil cartilage appear concentrate front fishs skull . possible dearden say cartilage back head simply preserve specimen.when jaw first appear fishis also still unclear added.nevertheless fossil fill gap knowledge evolution vertebrate head say paleobiologist lauren sallan assistant professor macroevolution unit okinawa institute science technology graduate university japan.this gap part ordovician ancestor jawed fish relatively rare mostly restrict shallow marine water . death remains early fish include eriptychius usually destroy wave find primarily piece say sallan research origin marine biodiversity involve study.as result limit fossil material almost complete head sallan tell cnn . preserve internal material fish huge discovery major step forward .
